    <!--
      The <html> element is the root element and defines the whole HTML document.
      It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.

      Inside the <html> element there is a <body> element.
      The <body> element defines the document's body.
      It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.

      Inside the <body> element there are two other elements: <h1> and <p>.
      The <h1> element defines a heading.
      The <p> element defines a paragraph.

      Some HTML elements will display correctly even if you forget the end tag.
      However, never rely on this! Unexpected results and errors may occur.
